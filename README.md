# My algorithms practice with Java
The main library I used in this project can be found on this [website](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

## The best solution I found so far
 - HW1: Union Find
 - HW2: Dynamic Programming
 - HW3: Data Structure - Stack
 - HW4: GrahamScan and Convex Hull
 - HW5: Priority queue
 - HW6: Event Driven Simulation
